- **Hierarchy** = expressing something in terms of parent and child relationship.

- In a Flat filesystem we cannot easily identify and access all of the files we stored on the computer, as classification is not there.

- In a hierarchical system as data/files are grouped in parents/child directories it would be quick to find the files by navigating to that directories. In addition we can enforce security or change of file attributes to the parent and child through inheritance.
