### **1. What is an Operating System?**

* An **Operating System (OS)** acts as a **layer between the end-user and the computer hardware**.
* It helps in **interacting with the hardware** of the computer efficiently.

### **2. Why Can't We Directly Program the Hardware? Why is an Operating System Needed?**

* **Hardware instruction sets** (assembly language) vary from one **vendor to another**.
* End-users **cannot directly change or program** these instructions.
* The **Operating System provides system routines** that can be used instead.
* The OS **translates system routines** into hardware instructions depending on the vendor.
* This translation makes programs **portable across multiple hardware platforms**.

**What are high level programming languages, why do we need to use them?**
While we write programs using System Routines of the operating system that program only works on that operating system and cannot be used on another since System Routines are different from one operating system to another.
To achieve operating system/platform portability programming languages comes into picture.

Programming languages provides their own english like language instruction set. Programmers writes their instructions using high level language instructions. Operating Systems can only understand System Routines, so these high level language instructions should be translated into operation system routines that where programming languages provides compilers/interpreters.
They provider compilers or interpreters for every platform (windows/linux/mac).

**Hardware portability = operating system**
**Platform portability = programming language**

Linux is an operating system = it is helpful for achieving hardware portability, and interacts with the underlying hardware of the machine.  
Linux has a key component called "Kernel" that defines the operating system.

UNIX = commercial source/runtime  
LINUX = free distributed and freely modifiable (open source) = "Kernel" = Command-Line Interaction  

There are few folks understood it is not user-friendly to Linux Kernal and started a project called GNU Linux  

## Open source software utilities (GUI), (Network) (System Software)(Software Utilities)  
In GNU Linux the started producing/distributing software components for Linux Kernal like GUI, NETWORKING, SYSTEM SOFTWARES AND SOFTWARE UTILITIES  

- Linux Kernal [install]  
  - download software built as part of GNU Linux and install on Kernal
  - Linux Operating System(Command Line Interface)**Communicate** -> Hardware(Difficult)
  - End-User(Programmer)Install Linux Kernal Download GNU Linux Software Utilities and install then on Kernal

- There are few software manufacture companies came forward and started distributing linux as single piece.
  - Linux Kernal + GNU Linux Software Utilities and provided together.Linux Distro
